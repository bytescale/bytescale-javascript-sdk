# Upload.js

**New library: launched December 2021!**

How to use:

1.  [Create an Upload.js account](https://upload.io).

2.  Grab your API key.

3.  Use one of [the examples](#examples) to create an upload button!

## What does Upload.js do?

**Upload.js makes it incredibly easy to add file uploads and file transformations to your website.**

Upload.js is both a platform ([upload.io](https://upload.io/)) and an NPM package (`upload-js`): the platform provides beautiful dashboards to monitor usage and for creating URL-based file transformations, while the NPM package provides a lightweight helper function for easily adding file upload buttons to your website.

Upload.js benefits:

- **üöÄ Fast uploads & downloads** 

  Our CDN covers 200+ edge locations across 47 countries.

- **üèó URL-based transformations**

  Transform any uploaded file on-demand, e.g. resizing images, extracting archives, etc.

- **üîì File security**

  Limit downloads to only the signed-in users of your web app, or grant access to everyone on the Internet.
