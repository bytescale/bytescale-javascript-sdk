/**
 * A lightweight mutex. (Other libraries contain too many features and we want to keep the size upload-js down).
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - Non-reentrant.
 * - Unfair. (Multiple callers awaiting 'acquire' will be granted the mutex in no order.)
 *   - When calling `safe` consecutively with no 'awaits' in-between, the current context will synchronously acquire
 *     the mutex every time.
